I am a software engineer at Zoox working on motion planning for self-driving vehicles.
Before that, I am a Ph.D. student in the Electrical and Systems Engineering Department at University of Pennsylvania supervised by Dr. Vijay Kumar. 
My research interests span from estimation to stochastic control with robotic applications.
