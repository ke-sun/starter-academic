abstract: Abstract One of the most challenging tasks for a flying robot is to autonomously
  navigate between target locations quickly and reliably while avoiding obstacles
  in its path, and with little to no a priori knowledge of the operating environment.
  This challenge is addressed in the present paper. We describe the system design
  and software architecture of our proposed solution and showcase how all the distinct
  components can be integrated to enable smooth robot operation. We provide critical
  insight on hardware and software component selection and development and present
  results from extensive experimental testing in real-world warehouse environments.
  Experimental testing reveals that our proposed solution can deliver fast and robust
  aerial robot autonomous navigation in cluttered, GPS-denied environments.
